# Data Acquisition - Backplane

| :warning: WARNING                                               |
| :-------------------------------------------------------------- |
| This design is an unverified work in progress (as of May 2023). |

## Overview

The backplane is is a passive motherboard that accepts plugin boards with the functionality of the DAQ system.

## Design decisions

* Passive only, all components are on plugin boards.
* Using common PCIE X8 98 pins connectors, but backplane and plugin boards are not PCIE compatible.
* Symmetric. Slots are interchangeable and boards can be plugged in any socket. Conflict resolution is delegated to the plugin boards, e.g. using jumpers.
* Scalable. Versions with more/less slots can be easily derived.
* Includes a power in and an uncommitted auxiliary connector.
* Using through hole connectors for mechanical rigidity but can be converted to a SMD version if desired.
* Working voltages such as 5V or 3.3V are generated on the plugin boards from VIN, locally, or a single power supply board can provide the rails via the bus.
* Sufficient signal integrity and bandwidth. The backplane is intended for relatively slow signals at the order of 1Mhz,that are driven directly by an MCU and peripherals,  and thus uses only 4 PCB layers for connectivity with no ground planes.

## Signals Assignment

As of May 2023, these are the assigned bus pins. All are reserved.

| Pin | Signal | Notes                            | Pin | Signal | Notes               |
| --- | ------ | -------------------------------- | --- | ------ | ------------------- |
| B1  | +5V    | Generated by Power Supply board. | A1  | GND    |                     |
| B2  | +5V    | Generated by Power Supply board. | A2  | GND    |                     |
| B3  | +5V    | Generated by Power Supply board. | A3  | GND    |                     |
| B4  | +5V    | Generated by Power Supply board. | A4  | GND    |                     |
| ... |        |                                  |     |        |                     |
| B48 | VIN+   | Insulated from GND.              | A48 | VIN-   | Insulated from GND. |
