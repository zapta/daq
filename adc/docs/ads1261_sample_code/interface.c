	* How a communication error should get handled will largely depend on
	* personal preference and other system requirements; however, here are
	* some suggestions on how you may want to handle it...
	*
	* 1) Try to re-send the command. In case of a glitch on the SPI,
	* re-sending the command may be all that is needed to correct the issue.
	* To correct for the possibility of SPI communication being out of sync
	* with SCLK, toggle the /CS pin or wait for the SPI auto-reset timeout
	* of the device (if enabled) before trying to re-sending the last command.
	*
	* 2) If the device was previously using CRC mode, try re-sending the
	* command without the required CRC bytes. In case of a brown-out or
	* device reset, the CRC mode many no longer be enabled and the error
	* may be a result of the software trying to communicate in CRC mode.
	*
	* 3) Perform any relevant system self-diagnostic tests or operations.
	* For example, try to read back the ADS126x register settings, or
	* try resetting/reinitializing the system to restore proper operation.
	*
	* 4) Report or log the error and defer to the end-user for any necessary
	* corrective actions.
