Write static wrappers for rtos objects.


Changed all tasks semaphors and mutexes to be statically allocated.

Add unit test for data.copy_from(data).

port the serial packet library to RTOS.

Port the arduino tests and delete the arduino directory.

Play with the ADC.

Write script to fix openocd.


----------
Firmware

Verify the project build on Mac and Linux

revisit the issue of heap allocation policy, consider static allocation and type 1.


Fix build warnings.

Revisit the error handling in the serial and CDC logger drivers. Should we send to a trap?

Consider to switch the serial driver to use DMA instead of interrupts.

----------
Hardware

Add connector or USB module for data serial port.

Add jumper/switch/connector for serial loop for unit tests.

Consider to have damper resistors to the bus signals.

Consider using the hardware CRC to compute packet CRC.


Consider using the hardware CRC to compute packet CRC.
