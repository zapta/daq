Write ADC SPI driver.


---

Match the board configuration to weact example, especially the quadspi.


Write script to fix openocd.

Port the arduino tests and delete the arduino directory.

Add unit test for data.copy_from(data).

----------
Firmware

Verify the project build on Mac and Linux

revisit the issue of heap allocation policy, consider static allocation and type 1.


Fix build warnings.

Revisit the error handling in the serial and CDC logger drivers. Should we send to a trap?

Consider to switch the serial driver to use DMA instead of interrupts.

----------
Hardware

Add connector or USB module for data serial port.

Add jumper/switch/connector for serial loop for unit tests.

Consider to have damper resistors to the bus signals.

Consider using the hardware CRC to compute packet CRC.


Consider using the hardware CRC to compute packet CRC.
