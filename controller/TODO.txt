* In the pw_card, move all the function to the device class, as methods.

* In pw_card, move all state variables and device specific consts to the device class. 

* Have the I2C scheduler also passing the hi2c to the device.


------


* Add to the i2c devices a method on_scheduler_start() that passs scheduler info to the device (e.g. time between calls).

* Make kAds1115DeviceAddress a constructor paramter of I2cPwDevice()

* Add to i2c scheduler the ability to device cycle rate (per device). Add a cycle divider field.

* i2c scheduler should pass the cycle interval to the devices.

* move the i2c irqs handles to the scheduler

* Add type safety (e.g. using templates) to the user data pointer of static timer.

* In i2c scheduler, try to avoid exposing the timer_callback as public.

------

* Use  MUST_USE_VALUE where applicable.
